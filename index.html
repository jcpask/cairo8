    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p id="summary">
        The fundamental difference between  the data in chapter 7 and chapter 8 is this: chapter 7's data focused on distributions & frequency, while chapter 8's focuses on the changes of a variable over time.

        <h3>The Essay</h3>
        <p>
            Chapter 7 looks at data in the form of distributions, and how to best represent the data in this way.  Thinking about how to present median & mean, how to show distributions, and how they can conceal or distort what is really reflected there is important to work with them.  Frequencies bring with them certain challenges.

            Chapter 8 introduces the time-series.  A variable's changes over time, trend, seasonality, using ratio or logarithmic scale, etc. are applied to data.  This requires us to think differently, and understand pitfalls of plotting data over time differently: data is easily misrepresented or distorted depending on how one chooses to make sense of a variable's fluctuations over a given period of time.

        <h4>Pros/Cons of 3 Visualization techniques</h4>
        <p>
            First, a time series line chart can clearly lay out a variable's changes over time.  However, we need to tease out whether there are consistent fluctuations which impact what we're seeing and whether we're correctly identifying trends.  Additionally, there is noise that needs to be factored out.

        <p>
            Second, one could calculate indexes.  This helps better represent relevant changes.  However, they can get cluttered pretty quickly.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, one could calculate change ratios.  Just plotting changes over time could conceal a lot, so the change ratios can bring out particular periods/moments of intense fluctuation.  This is helpful, but might be a bit counterintuitive for some readers.
